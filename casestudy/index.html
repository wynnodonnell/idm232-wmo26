        Off the Plate Recipes: A Case Study
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Overview:
        <p class="text2">
            In this project I wanted to create a fully functioning cookbook style website page using PHP, CSS, HTML, and SQL. I first sketched wireframes, and created a design template for my website. After that was finished I created a static version of the site using HTML and CSS. I had to take the information about the recipes I wanted to put in the cookbook out of a PDF format, and put it all in a spreadsheet. After this was completed I integrated the spreadsheet into a database, and used that database to fill out the pages of the website using PHP and SLQ. As a final step to the project I implemented a search and filter function, also using PHP.

        Purpose:
        <p class="text2">
            To create a dynamical webpage that can access and display information from a database, has a working search feature and a working filter feature, and can smoothly transition from the main page to any page of the users choice and display the corresponding information on that page.

        The Problem:
        <p class="text2">
            I am doing this project as a way to learn PHP, and SQL, and as a way to practice my design process. At the start of this project I did not know PHP, or SQL, and barely even knew what they did. I hoped to learn PHP and SQL,  and what they do, and practice my design skills over the course of this project.
        </p>

    <div class="text">
        Goals:
        <p class="text2">
            This project will be a success if I can create a website that is dynamically generated from information from a spreadsheet, that can be searched and filtered, and that the information displayed on each page corresponds with the inputs the user has given. It is also important that the final result functions well, and looks good from a design perspective, and works on mobile, desktop, and tablet platforms.

        Sketches:
        <p class="text2">I created hand drawn wireframes for two different pages for this project, the main page and the recipe page. For each of the two pages I drew three different layouts, one for mobile, one for tablet, and one for desktop.</p>
        <p class="text2">The main, or home page, which features all the recipes laid out on the page, a search function, and a filter function. </p>
        <p class="text2">The recipe page features the individual steps, and images for the steps, laid out on it. It also has the ingredients list, cook time, servings, and calories per serving.</p>

        Style guides:
        <p class="text2">
            I created two style tiles for this project, the first one would be used for my Alpha and Beta builds of this project, however by the time the Final build was ready to be put out I was no longer loving my original color choice, and instead opted to go back and change out a few of the colors for ones that I liked more. I had created variables for the colors I was using, so this was as easy as changing the variable from one color to another.

       Alpha:
       <p class="text2">The Alpha build was the first of three phases. The Alpha was a static build, using placeholder text and images for the main and recipe pages. Each page on the site was fully working from a design perspective, but the PHP wasn't implemented yet, and would have to be added during the Beta and Final versions.</p>

But how do you know if it's done? There are numerous ways to test the doneness of your noodles when they’re cooking. Some folk wisdom says to throw a piece of pasta against the wall; if it sticks, it's done. As much fun as we had experimenting with this method, we found the best way to test the pasta was, shockingly, by tasting it. In Italian, ""al dente"" means ""to the tooth,"" meaning that it's still slightly firm to the bite. As your pasta cooks, periodically (and carefully) taste a piece of it. If it's still too firm, let it cook a little longer. In some of our recipes, we specify to remove the pasta from the pot when it's ""just shy of al dente."" This is because, later, the pasta will be cooked in a sauce. Removing the pasta from the water just before it's al dente will ensure that the final product isn't overcooked."

In others, we only specify to heat a pot of boiling water and add the grains to it. For the grain in this recipe, an exact ratio of water to grain isn't necessary. You just need enough boiling water to give the grain some room and let it dance: a few quarts will do. We chose this method because it's more streamlined and easier for hearty grains (like farro, spelt and wild rice). Just think: cook it like pasta!"

Enjoy!",How to Make Sure Your Pasta is Al Dente,"Nothing beats perfectly cooked, al dente pasta. But how do you know if it's done? There are numerous ways to test the doneness of your noodles when they’re cooking. Some folk wisdom says to throw a piece of pasta against the wall; if it sticks, it's done. As much fun as we had experimenting with this method, we found the best way to test the pasta was, shockingly, by tasting it. In Italian, ""al dente"" means ""to the tooth,"" meaning that it's still slightly firm to the bite. As your pasta cooks, periodically (and carefully) taste a piece of it. If it's still too firm, let it cook a little longer. In some of our recipes, we specify to remove the pasta from the pot when it's ""just shy of al dente."" This is because, later, the pasta will be cooked in a sauce. Removing the pasta from the water just before it's al dente will ensure that the final product isn't overcooked."
